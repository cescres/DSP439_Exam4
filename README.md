#This is a repository containing python scripts defining functions for the purpose of:
	identifying kmers within a single genome sequence
	identifying the unique subsequent kmers both within the single sequene and in multiple sequences
	finding the smallest value of k such that each kmer only has 1 unique subsequent kmer
		smallest k value will print in terminal
