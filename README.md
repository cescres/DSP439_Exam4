# DSP439_Exam4
#This is a repository containing python scripts defining functions for the purpose of:
	identifying kmers within a single genome sequence
	identifying the unique subsequent kmers both within the single sequene and in multiple sequences
	finding the smallest value of k such that each kmer only has 1 unique subsequent kmer
		smallest k value will print in terminal
#also within this repository is the pytest code testing these functions

#The code deffining each of these functions in located within the file 'exam4_finalattempt.py', the pytest file is 'exam4_tests.py'
